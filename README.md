## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ivaylo Ivanov, a 17 years old Linux kernel and low level development enthusiast from ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬

I've been coding for 6 years by now. Not only that, I've gone to multiple national IT olympiads, reaching top 10 always, as well as participating in hackatons, having won 2nd place (and receiving a reward of 350 euros) in June 2024. I'm the author of a small secondary bootloader called "uniLoader" that works on almost all modern exynos devices. I've also been leading a project called "Mainline4Lumia", which provides mainline Linux for Lumia devices. In the past I've had to deal with EDK2, U-Boot, Darwin and a lot more OSS projects, as well as PCB design and 3d modeling.

I've done basic Linux SoC and device bring up for:
- Samsung Galaxy S8
- Powkiddy X51

And advanced for:
- Samsung Galaxy Xcover 3 Value Edition
- Microsoft Lumia 540
